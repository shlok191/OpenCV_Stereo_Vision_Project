# OpenCV Stereo Sensing Project

This project is an implementation of Stereo Camera Sensors used for accurate real-time generation of depth-maps of automobile/phone environments from images captured by cameras and/or LIDAR sensors. Depth maps assist with navigating environments for self-driving automobiles by providing a more hollistic description of the surrounding environment and the distance of detected obstacles. 

This project was implemented to test practical use of depth maps for RTSL applications for self-driving lunar rovers being worked on at the Simulations Based Engineering Lab (SBEL) organization as part of an upcoming NASA lunar rover mission scheduled for 2024!
